# 🏥 Medichain – Immutable Health Report Storage on Blockchain

![Uploading Screenshot (1).png…]()

## 📘 Project Description

**Medichain** is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) that provides a **secure, transparent, and immutable way to store health reports**.  
Built on the **Celo** blockchain, this smart contract ensures that once a medical report is added, it **cannot be modified or deleted**, preserving the integrity of health data forever.

This project is perfect for learning how to use Solidity for real-world applications in healthcare data security.

---

## 💡 What It Does

Medichain allows:
- The **contract owner (deployer)** to add health reports linked to unique patient IDs.  
- **Anyone** to view these reports on-chain at any time.  

By storing health report data (e.g., JSON strings, hashes, or summary texts) immutably, it provides a **trustless record system**—ideal for patient verification, medical research, and record transparency.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Immutable Storage:** Once a report is uploaded, it cannot be overwritten or removed.  
✅ **Ownership Control:** Only the deployer (owner) can add new reports, preventing unauthorized data injection.  
✅ **Public Transparency:** Anyone can retrieve stored reports securely and instantly.  
✅ **Event Logging:** Emits events (`ReportAdded`) for easy tracking and integration with off-chain systems.  
✅ **Celo Blockchain Powered:** Uses Celo’s eco-friendly blockchain for low-cost and accessible deployment.
